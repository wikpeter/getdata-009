There is only one script: run_analysis.R

It creates a function called runAnalysis()

It assumes that the original data is stored in a subdirectory called data.
The data can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

it performs the following tasks:<br>
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. <br>
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. <br>
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
